#### By _**Marie Dillard @milkybot**_

## Description
_A console program that let's you input a word and determines it's scrabble score through an equation._

## Specs
The desired (and achieved) goal is that if a user inputs a word, the program outputs it's score as if it was in a game of scrabble.

*Each letter represents a score in scrabble.*
* "A, E, I, O, U, L, N, R, S, T" = 1
* "B, C, M, P " = 3 : "F, H, V, W, Y " = 4
* "K" = 5
* "J, X" = 8
* "Q, Z" = 10

Example: "A" "1"
The program adds the numbers together and gives you a sum.
Example: "a, e, i, o, u" "5"
The program processes lower and upper case.
Example: "hEy" "9"
